                    If your sidebar and posts are already plastered with ads and
                    affiliate programs and then you ask for a few dollars you could just
                    push your readers a little too far and come across as greedy. I've
                    seen a few bloggers come close to this line of late -it's
                    interesting to see their readers pushing back. <br />if you get a
                    lot of traffic from sites like Digg, Google or other sources that
                    send youh reader loyalty it might be worth trying.
